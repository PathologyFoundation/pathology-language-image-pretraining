PC_CACHE_FOLDER: is the folder in which cached embeddings are saved
PC_RESULTS_FOLDER: is the folder in which results are going to be saved
PC_EVALUATION_DATA_ROOT_FOLDER: this folder should point to the folder in which there are the evaluation dataset
PC_DEFAULT_BACKBONE: this should point at the backbone to use as default for PLIP
PC_CLIP_ARCH: this is the architecture for PLIP and BLIP (e.g., "ViT-B/32")
```

## Evaluation Scripts

All evaluation scripts are found in `path_eval/scripts`. They use the abstractions found in `path_eval/evaluation`

## Dataset Details

### Data Location

Classification Task
`/v2/evaluation_datasets/classification`

Retrieval Task
`/v2/evaluation_datasets/image_retrieval`


### Setup Images

Data has been generated by splitting using:
`seed=1_trainratio=0.70_size=224`

## Tasks

`text_style_4` Is the style used to run zero-shot classification
